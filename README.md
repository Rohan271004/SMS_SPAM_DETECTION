# SMS Spam Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based solution to detect spam messages in SMS texts. It provides a trained model and a web interface for testing messages.

## Features
Detect whether an SMS message is spam or not.
Pre-trained Naive Bayes model for classification.
Streamlit web application for user interaction.
